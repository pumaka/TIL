 * Euler's Equation
 *
 * The so called "most beautiful equation in the world"
 * This equation acts as a bridge between "exponential functions" and "trignometric functions"
 *
 * This program will try to represent exponential funcitons in trignometric and vice versa.
 * -Will also include visual representation of equation "exp(x) = sig((1/factorial(k))*(x**k)"
